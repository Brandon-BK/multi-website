              Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club based in
              Liverpool, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the
              top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the
              Football League the following year and has played its home games
              at Anfield since its formation. Domestically, the club has won 19
              League titles, eight FA Cups, a record nine League Cups and 16 FA
              Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won
              six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all
              English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club established
              itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the
              1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and
              Kenny Dalglish, led the club to a combined 11 League titles and
              four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in
              2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen
              Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league
              title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.
              Liverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs
              in the world. The club has long-standing rivalries with Manchester
              United and Everton. Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team
              changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip
              which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "You'll Never
              Walk Alone".
